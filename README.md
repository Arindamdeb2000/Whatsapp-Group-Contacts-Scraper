How to scrap whatsapp group contacts from https://web.whatsapp.com/
This will enable you to get group contacts from your whatsapp specific group you chose as a list on csv or excel

How to use it?
1. Open your "Whatsapp Web" from a browser: "https://web.whatsapp.com/"
2. Select a Whatsapp Group
3. Press F12 or Ctrl-Shift-I to open the browser console
4. Paste this whole code and press ENTER key
5. It will ask you to where to save your .csv file (It will already automatically input your Group Name as file name)

Now you can open your file and find your list of contacts which specifies the following:
The header will tell you the group name and number of contacts that it has in that group
Column A - num : will tell you the phone number of your contacts if not already registered in your phone's contact
Column B = name: will tell you the unlisted number's owner (name), and it will show NO_NAME if it's already listed in your contacts
Column C = img: will give you the link for the contact's profile picture for you to download manually
Column D = status: will give you the current status as of now from the particular contact

If this project has helped you please give me a "STAR" up above and help spread the news.

Thanks.
